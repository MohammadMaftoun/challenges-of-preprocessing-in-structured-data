Pre-processing data is intended to transform the raw data into an easier and more effective format for future processing steps.
This repository highlights the challenges of preprocessing structured data with keys.

    1) Handling Missing Data: Incomplete datasets are common, with missing values due to human error, system failures, or inconsistent data collection. Proper techniques such as imputation (mean, median, mode) or removing records must be used cautiously, as they can introduce bias.

    2) Dealing with Outliers: Outliers can distort statistical models and predictions. Identifying and treating outliers (e.g., by removing or capping them) requires careful consideration, as they may represent valuable insights rather than noise.

    3) Feature Scaling and Normalization: Data features can have varying scales (e.g., age vs. income), and algorithms like k-NN and SVM are sensitive to these differences. Normalizing or standardizing features ensures that each has an equal contribution to the model.

    4) Categorical Data Encoding: Structured data often contains categorical variables (e.g., gender, region). These need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding, which can lead to issues like dimensionality explosion with high cardinality features.

    5) Class Imbalance: In classification tasks, imbalanced classes can lead to biased models that favor the majority class. Techniques like resampling, SMOTE, or adjusting class weights help mitigate this issue.

    6) Data Leakage: Features that contain information from the target variable can lead to overly optimistic model performance. Detecting and avoiding data leakage requires careful inspection of the dataset.


Preprocessing in structured data is an essential step in the data analysis and machine learning pipeline. It applies cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a format suitable for analysis or model training. While structured data is commonly more systematic than unstructured data, it still presents challenges during preprocessing.
